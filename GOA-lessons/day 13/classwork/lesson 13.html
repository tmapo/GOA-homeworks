    <h2><b><i>Mona Lisa</i></b></h2>
    <center>
        <p>Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong>, probably the world’s
            most famous painting. It was painted sometime between <strong>1503 and 1519</strong>, when Leonardo was
            living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage
            in the 21st century. The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant
            landscape. Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo’s
            achievement. The three-quarter view, in which the sitter’s head turns toward the viewer, broke from the
            standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well
            into the 21st century. The sitter’s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo’s skillful handling of sfumato
            (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin. The
            delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate
            Leonardo’s studied observations and inexhaustible patience. Moreover, the sinuous curves of the sitter’s
            hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her. The sense of overall
            harmony achieved in the painting—especially apparent in the sitter’s faint smile—reflects Leonardo’s idea of
            the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo’s
            vision. In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the <strong>Mona Lisa</strong> set the standard
            for all future portraits.</p>

    <h2><b><i>The Starry Night</i></b></h2>
    <center>
        <p>The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky rolling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow
            crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs. One or two cypress trees, often described as
            flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement
            of the sky that they partly obscure. Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the lower right
            of the canvas. Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church,
            which rises as a beacon against the roiling blue hills. The tight organization of the houses suggests the
            welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting’s turbulence. Van Gogh painted
            the Starry Night during his year at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France,
            several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor. While at
            the asylum, he was encouraged to continue working, and he produced hundreds of paintings, including
            <strong>The Starry Night</strong>, one of the most famous. While at first van Gogh was indifferent to the
            subject that inspired it, he soon came to consider the work a failure compared to his earlier masterpieces.

    <h2><b><i>The Last Supper</i></b></h2>
    <center>
        <p>The Last Supper, painted between 1494 and the beginning of 1498, is considered perhaps the most important
            mural painting in the world, “a beautiful and marvelous thing”, as Giorgio Vasari wrote in his Lives of the
            Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, in which he speaks of Leonardo and describes the Last
            Supper.</p>
    </center>
    <center>
        <p>Painter, architect, sculptor, engineer, inventor, mathematician, anatomist and writer, Leonardo da Vinci
            embodied the ideal of the many-sided man dreamed of by the Italian Renaissance. The Last Supper offers
            perhaps the most complete testimony to his multifaceted genius, urge to experiment and inexhaustible
            curiosity. In the period when he was working on the painting, the last decade of the 15th century, Leonardo
            was busy with studies of light, sound, movement and human emotions and their expression. We find these
            interests reflected in the Last Supper, in which, perhaps more than in any other work, Leonardo tried to
            depict what he called the “motions of the soul” through postures, gestures and expressions.</p>
    </center>
    <center>
        <p>Since September 1998 the Last Supper, together with the church and the Dominican monastery of Santa Maria
            delle Grazie, have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site as “a unique artistic achievement, of an
            exceptional universal value that transcends all historical contingencies”. Among the reasons we can also
            read that “The Last Supper has exerted a considerable influence, not only on the development of an
            iconographic theme but also on the destiny of painting” and finally: “it is no exaggeration to say that this
            painting opened up a new era in art history”.</p>
    </center>
    <center>
        <p>Preserving this delicate painting and enabling the public to admire it is a daily challenge to the restorers,
            architects and art historians who look after it and use the finest technologies to ensure that the
            masterpiece is preserved and passed on to future generations.</p>

    <h2><i><b>Guernica</b></i></h2>
    <center>
        <p>Guernica, a large black-and-white oil painting executed by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso in 1937 following the
            German bombing of Guernica, a city in Spain’s Basque region. The complex painting received mixed reviews
            when it was shown in the Spanish Republic Pavilion at the world’s fair in Paris, but it became an icon as it
            traveled the world in ensuing years, raising controversies on its meaning. Picasso was living in Paris when
            the Spanish Republican government approached him in 1937 with a commission to produce a mural for their
            pavilion in that year’s fair. Spain was six months into its civil war—a military revolt undertaken by the
            Nationalists against the government—and the Republicans saw the international event as an opportunity to
            legitimize and to condemn the brutal tactics of Gen. Francisco Franco’s Nationalist army. Picasso, who
            rarely mixed politics and art, accepted.</p>
    </center>
    <center>
        <p>Several months later, German aircraft, at the request of the Nationalists, heavily bombed the city of
            Guernica on April 26. The three-hour long blitzkrieg nearly annihilated the city and killed or wounded
            one-third of the population. Coverage of the devastation set Picasso to work on the commission, and he
            completed the enormous painting (11.5 × 25.5 feet [3.49 × 7.77 metres]) in about three weeks.</p>
    </center>
    <center>
        <p>Displayed near the entrance of the Republican’s pavilion, Guernica was the first thing many visitors saw. The
            complex composition, with Picasso’s characteristic Cubist figures and disquieting representation of space,
            was not easy to read. A braying horse occupies the painting’s centre, stumbling over its fallen rider
            sprawled below and lit by the spiked rays of a light bulb above. A bellowing bull seems to encompass a
            wailing mother with her child laying slack in her arms. A ghostly figure emerges from an opening to the
            right, holding a gaslight, while a woman closer to the foreground raises her arms in despair. Farther back,
            flames and possibly bodies rise from the window. The dramatic subject is subdued, painted in the grisaille
            technique, a method using a neutral monochrome palette. Picasso said very little about the painting’s
            meaning, leaving interpretation to viewers, critics, and art historians. Although clear as an emotional
            response to war’s senseless violence, the painting, with its mismatched subjects, confounded world’s fair
            viewers. Whether it was successful as a political statement became a debate among scholars.</p>

    <center>
        <p>Munch’s The Scream is an icon of modern art, the Mona Lisa for our time. As Leonardo da Vinci evoked a
            Renaissance ideal of serenity and self-control, Munch defined how we see our own age – wracked with anxiety
            and uncertainty.
        
            <p> Essentially The Scream is autobiographical, an expressionistic construction based on Munch's actual experience of a scream piercing through nature while on a walk, after his two companions, seen in the background, had left him. Fitting the fact that the sound must have been heard at a time when his mind was in an abnormal state, Munch renders it in a style which if pushed to extremes can destroy human integrity. As previously noted, the flowing curves of art nouveau represent a subjective linear fusion imposed upon nature, whereby the multiplicity of particulars is unified into a totality of organic suggestion with feminine overtones. But man is part of nature, and absorption into such a totality liquidates the individual. Beginning at this time Munch included art nouveau elements in many pictures but usually only in a limited or modified way. Here, however, in depicting his own morbid experience, he has let go, and allowed the foreground figure to become distorted by the subjectivized flow of nature; the scream could be interpreted as expressing the agony of the obliteration of human personality by this unifying force. Significantly, although it was Munch himself who underwent the experience depicted, the protagonist bears no resemblance to him or anyone else. The creature in the foreground has been depersonalized and crushed into sexlessness or, if anything, stamped with a trace of the femininity of the world that has come close to assimilating it.</p>
