            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>Lions primarily inhabit grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands. They are commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population residing in the Gir Forest of India. Lions prefer open areas where they can hunt effectively, but they also need cover for resting and shelter.</p>

            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>Lions are apex predators and mainly hunt large herbivores such as zebras, antelopes, and buffaloes. They also scavenge from other predators when necessary. Lions generally hunt in groups, with the lionesses doing the majority of the hunting. They are opportunistic feeders and will take advantage of available food sources.</p>

        <section id="behavior">
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>Lions are social animals that live in groups called prides. A pride is usually made up of several females, their cubs, and one or two males. The males typically protect the pride from outside threats, while the females do most of the hunting. Lions are known for their roaring vocalizations, which can be heard up to 8 kilometers away. They are also known to sleep for up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy for hunting.</p>

        <section id="physical">
            <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Lions are characterized by their muscular build and distinctive mane (males). Male lions typically weigh between 150 to 250 kilograms, while females are smaller, weighing around 120 to 180 kilograms. Their tawny coats help them blend into their environment. Lions have sharp claws and teeth that aid in hunting and self-defense. The mane of a male lion is unique to the species and helps protect its neck during fights with rivals.</p>

        <section id="reproduction">
            <h2>Reproduction</h2>
            <p>Lions have a gestation period of about 110 days, after which a female lion gives birth to 1-4 cubs. Cubs are born blind and helpless and rely on their mother for care. They begin to crawl and open their eyes within a few days. After a few weeks, cubs start to play and learn vital hunting skills from the pride. Males typically don't participate in the rearing of cubs, but they may protect the pride. Cubs stay with their mother for up to 2-3 years before becoming independent.</p>

        <section id="conservation">
            <h2>Conservation</h2>
            <p>Despite being powerful predators, lions face numerous threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their natural habitats and ensuring the survival of their populations. Various organizations are working towards reducing human-wildlife conflict, creating wildlife corridors, and establishing protected areas where lions can thrive.</p>
