        <p>Lions are one of the most iconic big cats and are often referred to as the "king of the jungle." They are the
            only social species of big cats, living in groups called prides, which typically consist of related females,
            their offspring, and a few adult males. Lions are native to Africa, primarily found in savannas, grasslands,
            and
            open woodlands, although a small population exists in the Gir Forest of India.</p>

            alt="Elephant" width="300">
        <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, with two main species: the African elephant and the Asian
            elephant . African elephants are larger, with males weighing up to 14,000 pounds, while Asian elephants are
            slightly smaller. Elephants are known for their distinctive long trunks, large ears, and tusks (in African
            males
            and some females). Their trunks are highly versatile, functioning as a tool for grasping, breathing,
            drinking,
            and even social interaction.</p>

        <h2 id="penguin"><i><strong>Penguin</strong></i></h2>
        <img src="https://pngimg.com/d/madagascar_penguins_PNG63.png" alt="Penguin" width="300">
        <p>Penguins are flightless birds primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, with the majority living in
            Antarctica.
            They have a distinct black and white appearance, resembling a formal suit, which helps them blend into their
            aquatic environment. Penguins are excellent swimmers, using their flippers for propulsion in the water, and
            they
            can reach speeds of up to 15 miles per hour.</p>

        <img src="https://pngimg.com/d/giraffe_PNG13531.png" alt="Giraffe" width="300">
        <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, with males reaching heights of up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) and
            females slightly shorter. Their long necks, which contain the same number of vertebrae as most mammals
            (seven),
            allow them to reach leaves at the tops of trees, particularly acacias. This gives them an advantage over
            other
            herbivores when foraging.</p>

            alt="Dolphin" width="500">
        <p>Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals belonging to the family Delphinidae, and they are known for
            their
            playful behavior and strong social bonds. There are over 40 species of dolphins, the most well-known being
            the
            bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). They are found in oceans and some rivers around the world,
            preferring
            warmer coastal and shallow waters, although some species thrive in deep sea environments.</p>

        <h2 id="tiger"><i><strong>Tiger</strong></i></h2>
        <img src="https://pngimg.com/d/tiger_PNG23230.png" width="300">
        <p>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the largest species of big cats, known for their distinctive orange coat with
            black
            stripes. Each tiger's stripe pattern is unique, much like a fingerprint, helping them blend into their
            forested
            habitats. Tigers are solitary animals, preferring to roam and hunt alone in vast territories that can span
            several square miles, depending on the availability of prey.</p>

            alt="Kangaroo">
        <p>Kangaroos are marsupials native to Australia, known for their strong hind legs and hopping movement. They are
            herbivores, mainly eating grass, and live in groups called mobs. Female kangaroos carry their babies, called
            joeys, in a pouch until they're old enough to survive outside. There are several species, with the Red
            Kangaroo
            being the largest. They are an iconic symbol of Australia and are generally not endangered.</p>

        <h2 id="panda"><i><strong>Panda</strong></i></h2>
        <img src="https://pngimg.com/d/panda_PNG8.png" width="400">
        <p>Pandas are large, herbivorous bears native to China, known for their black-and-white fur. They primarily eat
            bamboo, which makes up most of their diet. Pandas are solitary and spend a lot of time eating. Although once
            endangered, conservation efforts have helped increase their population, though they remain vulnerable.</p>

        <h2 id="polar-bear"><i><strong>Polar Bear</strong></i></h2>
        <img src="https://pngimg.com/d/polar_bear_PNG14.png" width="400">
        <p>Polar bears are large carnivorous bears native to the Arctic region. They are well-adapted to cold
            environments,
            with thick fur and a layer of fat for insulation. Polar bears primarily hunt seals, using their keen sense
            of
            smell to locate prey. They are threatened by climate change and melting sea ice.</p>

        <h2 id="wolf"><i><strong>Wolf</strong></i></h2>
        <img src="https://pngimg.com/d/wolf_PNG356.png" width="300">
        <p>Wolves are carnivorous mammals known for their social structure and hunting in packs. They are found in
            various
            regions, from forests to tundras. Wolves mainly hunt large prey like deer and elk, using teamwork to capture
            it.
            They are intelligent, have strong family bonds, and play an important role in ecosystems.</p>
