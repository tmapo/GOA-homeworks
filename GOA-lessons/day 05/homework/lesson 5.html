<h2>Lion</h2>

<p>'Lion, king of the jungles' they say sometimes.
    wonder why, maybe becouse lions are meant to be the strongest, the bravest, but a soul without a weakness doesnt
    exist.
    Strange thing that people often say, is that lions are afraid of roosters,
    but it were just Greeks, who believed that lions were afraid of roosters. Several of Aesop's Fables reference this
    belief.

<h2>Elephant</h2>

<p>Many children think that elephants are the largest animals of them all, but they arent, so dont be afraid of big
    problems, bigger ones could've existed.
    The strange myth about them is that they are afraid of mice, because they can crawl up in holes, located in elephant
    feet.
    But the myth is busted, elephants dont mind mice that sometimes crawl on their faces
